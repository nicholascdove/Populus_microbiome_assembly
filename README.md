- Raw data can be found in the Sequence Read Archive under project ID <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/685817">685817</a>.

- Or use my pre-made feature, taxonomy, and metadata tables found in this repository

- Inputs and outputs for community assembly models can be found in the Data folder. However, code to conduct these models can be found at <a href="https://github.com/stegen/Stegen_etal_ISME_2013">https://github.com/stegen/Stegen_etal_ISME_2013</a>. For this dataset, these models should be run on multiple nodes with high numbers of CPUs and memory (i.e., don't run these models on your local machine with such a large dataset).

- Please contact Nicholas Dove (dovenc@ornl.gov) with any questions or comments. I'm always happy to help :).
